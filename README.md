This is a face recognition app. It recognizes person in a webcam or a phone using 
personal face  landmarks. Person's image needs to be uploaded first, so that face 
desriptotors along with a name are stored in a database. This face recognition app 
uses face-api.js for ML algorithm, react UI for a frontend, node.js for a backend 
and mongoDB database.

To start face recognition go to the "Data" tab and upload person(s) pics. Then go 
to 'Cam' tab and press 'Start predict', afterwards 'Stop predict'. The AI model 
needs to get loaded before you can begin.
